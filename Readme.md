# Quantum NLP with Cirq: Advanced Transformer Embedding

This repository contains **Quantum NLP** experiments and code integrating **Cirq** (a quantum framework by Google) with Transformer-based NLP. The project showcases a novel approach to embedding and classifying text using **quantum circuits** and multi-axis rotations in training. It aims to demonstrate how quantum properties—**superposition** and **entanglement**—can enrich classical NLP tasks, such as next-word prediction and sequence classification.

1. **AdvTransformerCirq.ipynb**  
   Demonstrates the *complete training pipeline* of a quantum-enhanced Transformer approach. It shows how the Cirq-based quantum circuits are integrated with classical NLP embeddings, focusing on parameter-shift gradient methods and momentum-based optimizers for a hybrid quantum-classical workflow.

2. **cirqImplementation.ipynb**  
   Contains separate or earlier-stage Cirq code blocks for testing quantum gates, verifying multi-qubit entanglement strategies, or performing debugging of circuit components.

3. **file.txt**  
   A placeholder text file, which could store mini-datasets, instructions, or logs for quick reference.

4. **model.py**  
   Houses the *inference pipeline* for the quantum-based NLP model.  
   - **`chat(input_sequence)`**: A function that takes a 3-word sequence as input and returns the predicted next word.  
   - Loads `trained_parameters.pkl` to set up the quantum circuit angles, ensuring consistency with the training.

5. **trained_parameters.pkl**  
   The final quantum+classical parameter dictionary, serialized via pickle. These parameters represent rotation angles and classical embeddings from the advanced quantum-classical training session.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Cirq** (tested with version >= 0.13)
- **NumPy** (for classical vector ops)
- **Sympy** (symbolic manipulation is needed)
- **Matplotlib** (optional, for visualizing training curves or Bloch spheres)
- **Jupyter** (for running the notebooks interactively)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository: (Gated Repo)
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/passionateSandy2004/Quantum-NLP.git
   cd Quantum-NLP
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   you can manually install Cirq, NumPy, etc.

3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Notebooks

- **AdvTransformerCirq.ipynb**  
  This is the main notebook demonstrating the entire training loop.  
  - **Recommended**: Open in JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook.
  - Run the cells sequentially to see how the quantum circuit is constructed, how the classical embeddings are integrated, and how the parameter-shift rule is used to compute gradients.

- **cirqImplementation.ipynb**  
  A simpler or earlier-phase demonstration of Cirq-based quantum gates, parameter sweeps, or small tests. It can be used to understand the building blocks before diving into the full pipeline.

### Inference

The `model.py` script provides an easy interface to load the quantum-classical hybrid model’s trained parameters and perform a next-word prediction:

```bash
python model.py
```

Or, in a Python shell/notebook:

```python
import model

predicted_word = model.chat(["quantum", "computing", "is"])
print("Next word predicted:", predicted_word)
```

You can adjust the sequence or integrate this function into a more elaborate pipeline. Make sure `trained_parameters.pkl` is present in the same directory, or update the path inside `model.py`.

## Model Description

1. **Quantum Embedding**  
   - Each word in the input sequence is mapped to a 3-axis rotation (Rx, Ry, Rz) on distinct qubits, using angle sets determined by word embeddings.  
   - Cirq’s parameter-shift rule is employed to compute gradients, iterating toward an optimal set of angles that best separate or predict the next word.

2. **Transformer Blocks**  
   - Classical multi-head attention layers process the embedding vectors from the quantum circuit.  
   - The synergy: quantum states capture complex correlations (via entanglement), while Transformers handle sequence-level attention patterns.

3. **Training**  
   - `AdvTransformerCirq.ipynb` implements a step-by-step pipeline:  
     1. Read text data  
     2. Tokenize & map words to initial angles  
     3. Evolve states in a Cirq circuit  
     4. Compute parameter-shift gradients  
     5. Backprop through the classical attention layers  
     6. Update parameters

4. **Inference**  
   - `model.py` loads the final angles and classical layers to quickly generate next-word predictions from any 3-word context.

## Potential Applications

- **Zero-shot or few-shot text classification** in specialized domains where data is minimal, but quantum generalization might help.
- **Entanglement-based text embeddings** that can complement or replace purely classical embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).
- **Hybrid HPC** scenarios where partial computations are offloaded to quantum simulators or NISQ devices, especially for large vocabulary or complex domain-specific corpora.
